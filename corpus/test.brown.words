Thirty-three 

Scotty 
did    
not    
go     
back   
to     
school 
.      

His          
parents      
talked       
seriously    
and          
lengthily    
to           
their        
own          
doctor       
and          
to           
a            
specialist   
at           
the          
University   
Hospital     
--           
Mr.          
McKinley     
was          
entitled     
to           
a            
discount     
for          
members      
of           
his          
family       
--           
and          
it           
was          
decided      
it           
would        
be           
best         
for          
him          
to           
take         
the          
remainder    
of           
the          
term         
off          
,            
spend        
a            
lot          
of           
time         
in           
bed          
and          
,            
for          
the          
rest         
,            
do           
pretty       
much         
as           
he           
chose        
--           
provided     
,            
of           
course       
,            
he           
chose        
to           
do           
nothing      
too          
exciting     
or           
too          
debilitating 
.            

His       
teacher   
and       
his       
school    
principal 
were      
conferred 
with      
and       
everyone  
agreed    
that      
,         
if        
he        
kept      
up        
with      
a         
certain   
amount    
of        
work      
at        
home      
,         
there     
was       
little    
danger    
of        
his       
losing    
a         
term      
.         

Scotty       
accepted     
the          
decision     
with         
indifference 
and          
did          
not          
enter        
the          
arguments    
.            

He          
was         
discharged  
from        
the         
hospital    
after       
a           
two-day     
checkup     
and         
he          
and         
his         
parents     
had         
what        
Mr.         
McKinley    
described   
as          
a           
``          
celebration 
lunch       
''          
at          
the         
cafeteria   
on          
the         
campus      
.           

Rachel     
wore       
a          
smart      
hat        
and        
,          
because    
she        
had        
been       
warned     
recently   
about      
smoking    
,          
puffed     
at         
her        
cigarettes 
through    
a          
long       
ivory      
holder     
stained    
with       
lipstick   
.          

Scotty          
's              
father          
sat             
sprawled        
in              
his             
chair           
,               
angular         
,               
alert           
as              
a               
cricket         
,               
looking         
about           
at              
the             
huge            
stainless-steel 
appointments    
of              
the             
room            
with            
an              
expression      
of              
proprietorship  
.               

Teachers   
--         
men        
who        
wore       
brown      
suits      
and        
had        
gray       
hair       
and        
pleasant   
smiles     
--         
came       
to         
their      
table      
to         
talk       
shop       
and        
to         
be         
introduced 
to         
Scotty     
and        
Rachel     
.          

Rachel      
was         
polite      
,           
Scotty      
indifferent 
.           

They      
ate       
the       
cafeteria 
food      
with      
its       
orange    
sauces    
and       
Scotty    
gazed     
without   
interest  
at        
his       
food      
,         
the       
teachers  
,         
the       
heroic    
baronial  
windows   
,         
and       
the       
bright    
ranks     
of        
college   
banners   
.         

His    
father 
tried  
to     
make   
the    
food   
a      
topic  
.      

``        
The       
blueberry 
pie       
is        
good      
,         
Scotty    
.         

I         
recommend 
it        
''        
.         

He      
looked  
at      
his     
son     
,       
his     
face    
worried 
.       

Scotty   
murmured 
,        
``       
No       
,        
thanks   
''       
,        
so       
softly   
his      
father   
had      
to       
bend     
his      
gaunt    
height   
across   
the      
table    
and      
turn     
a        
round    
brown    
ear      
to       
him      
.        

Scotty   
regarded 
the      
ear      
and      
the      
grizzled 
hair     
around   
it       
with     
a        
moment   
of       
interest 
.        

He     
said   
more   
loudly 
,      
``     
I      
'm     
full   
,      
old    
Pop    
''     
.      

He              
had             
eaten           
almost          
nothing         
on              
the             
crested         
,               
three-sectioned 
plate           
and             
had             
drunk           
about           
half            
the             
milk            
in              
its             
paper           
container       
.               

``     
He     
's     
all    
right  
,      
Craig  
''     
,      
Rachel 
said   
.      

``        
I         
can       
fix       
him       
something 
later     
in        
the       
afternoon 
when      
we        
get       
home      
''        
.         

Since        
his          
seizure      
,            
Scotty       
had          
had          
little       
appetite     
;            
;            
yet          
his          
changed      
appearance   
,            
surprisingly 
,            
was          
one          
of           
plumpness    
.            

His             
face            
was             
fuller          
;               
;               
his             
lips            
and             
the             
usually         
sharp           
lines           
of              
his             
jaw             
had             
become          
swollen-looking 
.               

He         
breathed   
now        
with       
his        
mouth      
open       
,          
showing    
a          
whitely    
curving    
section    
of         
lower      
teeth      
;          
;          
he         
kept       
his        
eyes       
,          
with       
their      
puffed     
blurred    
lids       
,          
always     
lowered    
,          
though     
not        
,          
apparently 
,          
focusing   
.          

Even      
his       
neck      
seemed    
thicker   
and       
,         
therefore 
,         
shorter   
.         

His        
hands      
,          
which      
had        
been       
as         
quick      
as         
a          
pair       
of         
fluttering 
birds      
,          
were       
now        
neither    
active     
nor        
really     
relaxed    
.          

They       
lay        
on         
his        
lap        
,          
palms      
up         
,          
stiffly    
motionless 
,          
the        
tapered    
fingers    
a          
little     
thick      
at         
the        
joints     
.          

Altogether   
he           
had          
,            
since        
the          
seizure      
,            
the          
appearance   
of           
a            
boy          
who          
overindulged 
in           
food         
and          
took         
no           
exercise     
.            

He        
looked    
lazy      
,         
spoiled   
,         
a         
little    
querulous 
.         

Rachel 
had    
little 
to     
say    
.      

She        
greeted    
her        
husband    
's         
colleagues 
with       
smiling    
politeness 
,          
offering   
nothing    
.          

Mr.         
McKinley    
,           
for         
all         
his         
sprawling   
and         
his         
easy        
familiarity 
,           
was         
completely  
alert       
to          
his         
son         
,           
eyes        
always      
on          
the         
still       
face        
,           
jumping     
to          
anticipate  
Scotty      
's          
desires     
.           

It       
was      
a        
strained 
,        
silent   
lunch    
.        

Rachel 
said   
,      
``     
I      
'd     
better 
get    
him    
to     
bed    
''     
.      

The       
doctors   
had       
suggested 
Scotty    
remain    
most      
of        
every     
afternoon 
in        
bed       
until     
he        
was       
stronger  
.         

Since    
Mr.      
McKinley 
had      
to       
give     
a        
lecture  
,        
Rachel   
and      
Scotty   
drove    
home     
alone    
in       
the      
Plymouth 
.        

They  
did   
not   
speak 
much  
.     

Scotty 
gazed  
out    
at     
ugly   
gray   
slums  
and    
said   
softly 
,      
``     
Look   
at     
those  
stupid 
kids   
''     
.      

It          
was         
a           
Negro       
section     
of          
peeling     
row         
houses      
,           
store-front 
churches    
and         
ragged      
children    
.           

Rachel 
had    
to     
bend   
toward 
Scotty 
and    
ask    
him    
to     
repeat 
.      

He      
said    
,       
``      
Nothing 
''      
.       

And    
then   
:      
``     
There  
are    
lots   
of     
kids   
around 
here   
''     
.      

Scotty   
looked   
at       
the      
children 
,        
his      
mouth    
slightly 
opened   
,        
his      
eyes     
dull     
.        

He    
felt  
tired 
and   
full  
and   
calm  
.     

Thirty-four 

the     
days    
seemed  
short   
,       
perhaps 
because 
his     
routine 
was     
,       
each    
day     
,       
almost  
the     
same    
.       

He        
rose      
late      
and       
went      
down      
in        
his       
bathrobe  
and       
slippers  
to        
have      
breakfast 
either    
alone     
or        
with      
Rachel    
.         

Virginia  
treated   
him       
with      
attention 
and       
tried     
to        
tempt     
his       
appetite  
with      
special   
food      
:         
biscuits  
,         
cookies   
,         
candies   
--        
the       
result    
of        
devoted   
hours     
in        
the       
tiled     
kitchen   
.         

She       
would     
hover     
over      
him       
and       
,         
looking   
like      
her       
brother   
,         
anxiously 
watch     
the       
progress  
of        
Scotty    
's        
fork      
or        
spoon     
.         

``     
You    
do     
n't    
eat    
enough 
,      
honey  
.      

Try  
to   
get  
that 
down 
''   
.    

Rachel     
,          
observing  
,          
would      
say        
,          
``         
He         
has        
to         
rediscover 
his        
own        
capacity   
.          

It   
'll  
take 
time 
''   
.    

Virginia   
and        
Rachel     
talked     
to         
each       
other      
quietly    
now        
,          
as         
allies     
who        
are        
political  
rather     
than       
natural    
might      
in         
a          
war        
atmosphere 
.          

Both       
watched    
Scotty     
constantly 
,          
Rachel     
without    
seeming    
to         
,          
Virginia   
openly     
,          
her        
eyes       
filled     
with       
concern    
.          

Scotty  
was     
neutral 
.       

He          
did         
not         
resent      
their       
supervision 
or          
Virginia    
's          
sometimes   
tiring      
sympathy    
.           

He        
ate       
what      
he        
felt      
like      
,         
slept     
as        
much      
or        
as        
little    
as        
he        
pleased   
,         
and       
moved     
about     
the       
draughty  
rooms     
of        
the       
house     
,         
when      
he        
was       
not       
in        
bed       
,         
with      
slow      
,         
dubious   
steps     
,         
like      
an        
elderly   
tourist   
in        
a         
cathedral 
.         

His    
energy 
was    
gone   
.      

He      
was     
able    
,       
now     
,       
to      
sit     
for     
hours   
in      
a       
chair   
in      
the     
living  
room    
and     
stare   
out     
at      
the     
bleak   
yard    
without 
moving  
.       

His      
hands    
lay      
loosely  
,        
yet      
stiffly  
--       
they     
were     
like     
wax      
hands    
:        
almost   
lifelike 
,        
not      
quite    
--       
folded   
in       
his      
lap      
;        
;        
his      
mouth    
hung     
slightly 
open     
.        

When        
he          
was         
asked       
a           
question    
or          
addressed   
in          
such        
a           
way         
that        
some        
response    
was         
inescapable 
,           
he          
would       
answer      
;           
;           
if          
,           
as          
often       
happened    
,           
he          
had         
to          
repeat      
because     
he          
had         
spoken      
too         
softly      
,           
he          
would       
repeat      
his         
words       
in          
the         
same        
way         
,           
without     
emphasis    
or          
impatience  
,           
only        
a           
little      
louder      
.           

He        
had       
not       
mentioned 
Kate      
.         

He           
had          
not          
even         
thought      
about        
her          
much         
except       
once         
or           
twice        
at           
night        
in           
bed          
when         
his          
slowly       
ranging      
thoughts     
would        
abruptly     
,            
almost       
accidentally 
,            
encounter    
her          
.            

At           
these        
times        
he           
felt         
a            
kind         
of           
pain         
in           
his          
upper        
chest        
,            
but          
it           
was          
an           
objective    
pain         
,            
in           
no           
way          
different    
from         
others       
in           
intensity    
and          
not          
different    
in           
kind         
;            
;            
it           
was          
like         
the          
bandaged     
wound        
on           
the          
back         
of           
his          
head         
which        
occasionally 
throbbed     
;            
;            
it           
was          
merely       
another      
part         
of           
his          
weakness     
.            

He      
was     
calm    
,       
drugged 
,       
and     
lazy    
.       

He   
did  
not  
care 
.    

Rachel    
mentioned 
Kate      
.         

She      
said     
,        
``       
I        
notice   
the      
girl     
from     
across   
the      
street   
has      
n't      
bothered 
to       
phone    
or       
visit    
''       
.        

Scotty 
said   
,      
``     
That   
's     
all    
right  
.      

Kate  
's    
all   
right 
''    
.     

He           
thought      
about        
it           
briefly      
,            
then         
deliberately 
turned       
the          
talk         
to           
something    
else         
.            

Once    
,       
sitting 
at      
the     
front   
window  
in      
his     
parents 
'       
room    
,       
he      
saw     
Kate    
come    
out     
of      
her     
house   
.       

She       
was       
with      
Elizabeth 
.         

They   
were   
far    
off    
and    
looked 
tiny   
.      

The      
heavy    
branches 
in       
his      
front    
yard     
would    
hide     
and      
then     
reveal   
them     
.        

They      
turned    
at        
the       
bottom    
of        
Kate      
's        
steps     
and       
moved     
off       
in        
the       
direction 
of        
the       
park      
.         

He         
thought    
he         
saw        
--         
it         
awakened   
and        
,          
for        
a          
moment     
,          
interested 
him        
--         
that       
Elizabeth  
held       
a          
leash      
in         
her        
hand       
and        
that       
a          
round      
fuzzy      
puppy      
was        
on         
the        
end        
of         
the        
leash      
.          

Then        
they        
disappeared 
and         
Scotty      
got         
up          
and         
went        
into        
his         
own         
room        
and         
got         
into        
bed         
.           

By        
the       
time      
he        
was       
under     
the       
covers    
he        
had       
forgotten 
about     
seeing    
Kate      
.         

The        
doctor     
,          
since      
Scotty     
was        
no         
longer     
allowed    
to         
make       
his        
regular    
trips      
into       
town       
to         
see        
him        
,          
came       
often      
and        
informally 
to         
the        
house      
.          

He           
would        
sit          
,            
slim-waisted 
and          
spare        
,            
on           
the          
edge         
of           
Scotty       
's           
bed          
,            
his          
legs         
crossed      
so           
elaborately  
that         
the          
crossed      
foot         
could        
tap          
the          
floor        
.            

Scotty    
did       
not       
mind      
the       
doctor    
's        
unsmiling 
teasing   
as        
he        
used      
to        
.         

``       
Husky    
young    
man      
''       
,        
he       
said     
with     
mock     
distaste 
.        

``       
I        
imagine  
you      
're      
always   
battling 
in       
school   
''       
.        

``     
I      
do     
n't    
go     
to     
school 
any    
more   
''     
.      

``     
Pardon 
''     
?      
?      

The      
doctor   
had      
to       
bend     
close    
to       
hear     
;        
;        
his      
delicate 
hand     
,        
as       
veined   
as       
a        
moth     
's       
wing     
,        
rested   
absently 
on       
Scotty   
's       
chest    
.        

Scotty 
said   
the    
same   
words  
more   
loudly 
.      

`` 
Oh 
.  

Well     
,        
we       
're      
taking   
a        
little   
vacation 
,        
that     
's       
all      
''       
.        

He          
turned      
unsmilingly 
to          
Rachel      
.           

``     
I      
think  
by     
the    
end    
of     
next   
week   
he     
could  
get    
out    
in     
the    
air    
a      
little 
.      

He            
could         
now           
but           
the           
weakness      
is            
very          
definite      
;             
;             
it            
would         
exhaust       
him           
further       
and           
unnecessarily 
.             

He       
'll      
be       
stronger 
soon     
''       
.        

His         
stethoscope 
was         
on          
the         
table       
by          
Scotty      
's          
bed         
and         
he          
picked      
it          
up          
and         
wagged      
it          
at          
Scotty      
.           

He       
said     
fussily  
,        
``       
Just     
keep     
the      
cap      
on       
those    
strong   
emotions 
''       
.        

The         
stethoscope 
glinted     
silver      
in          
the         
darkening   
room        
.           

``    
I     
'll   
drop  
by    
again 
in    
a     
few   
days  
''    
.     

Rachel 
stayed 
on     
after  
the    
doctor 
had    
gone   
.      

She      
smoothed 
the      
covers   
on       
Scotty   
's       
bed      
and      
picked   
things   
up       
from     
the      
floor    
.        

She   
did   
not   
touch 
him   
.     

Scotty      
watched     
with        
disinterest 
.           

He    
did   
not   
speak 
.     

He     
had    
no     
desire 
to     
.      

She    
said   
,      
``     
Do     
you    
think  
you    
'll    
miss   
school 
''     
?      
?      

He        
had       
noticed   
how       
formal    
and       
irritably 
exact     
Rachel    
had       
grown     
.         

He   
did  
not  
care 
.    

He           
felt         
her          
irritability 
did          
not          
concern      
him          
,            
yet          
he           
knew         
he           
would        
not          
care         
even         
if           
it           
did          
.            

He    
shook 
his   
head  
.     

``     
We     
've    
had    
any    
number 
of     
calls  
about  
you    
.      

You        
could      
win        
a          
popularity 
contest    
at         
that       
school     
without    
any        
trouble    
.          

Miss      
Estherson 
called    
twice     
.         

She   
wants 
to    
pay   
you   
a     
visit 
.     

She      
says     
the      
children 
miss     
you      
.        

Apparently 
you        
were       
the        
light      
of         
their      
lives      
''         
.          

Scotty   
shrugged 
slightly 
.        

Rachel 
came   
close  
to     
the    
bed    
,      
bent   
as     
if     
she    
would  
kiss   
him    
,      
then   
moved  
away   
.      

She      
was      
frowning 
.        

``     
That   
doctor 
annoys 
me     
''     
.      

She     
seemed  
to      
speak   
to      
herself 
.       

``                 
Do                 
you                
suppose            
his                
self-consciousness 
is                 
characteristic     
of                 
the                
new                
Negro              
professionals      
or                 
merely             
of                 
doctors            
in                 
general            
''                 
?                  
?                  

She    
turned 
to     
him    
again  
.      

``      
Well    
,       
Mrs.    
Charles 
--      
Sally   
--      
has     
phoned  
too     
.       

She     
was     
very    
worried 
''      
.       

Rachel 
's     
tone   
was    
dry    
.      

``         
She        
did        
n't        
really     
say        
''         
--         
She        
glanced    
away       
at         
the        
floor      
,          
then       
swooped    
gracefully 
and        
picked     
up         
one        
of         
Scotty     
's         
slippers   
.          

``     
I      
mean   
,      
do     
you    
feel   
like   
seeing 
Kate   
''     
?      
?      

Scotty 
said   
,      
``     
I      
do     
n't    
know   
''     
.      

It   
was  
true 
.    

He  
did 
not 
.   

There     
was       
the       
slight    
pain      
,         
but       
it        
was       
no        
different 
from      
the       
throbbing 
in        
his       
head      
.         

``    
Well  
,     
there 
's    
time  
,     
in    
any   
case  
.     

We       
'll      
wait     
till     
you      
're      
stronger 
and      
then     
talk     
about    
it       
''       
.        

She     
put     
the     
slipper 
neatly  
by      
its     
mate    
at      
the     
foot    
of      
the     
bed     
.       

Scotty 
said   
,      
``     
Okay   
''     
.      

This     
time     
Rachel   
kissed   
him      
lightly  
on       
the      
forehead 
.        

Scotty  
was     
pleased 
.       

His      
father   
was      
a        
constant 
visitor  
.        

Scotty  
would   
hear    
the     
front   
door    
in      
the     
evening 
and     
then    
his     
father  
's      
deep    
slow    
voice   
;       
;       
it      
floated 
up      
the     
stairs  
.       

``     
How    
's     
Scotty 
''     
?      
?      

And      
Rachel   
's       
or       
Virginia 
's       
reply    
:        
``       
better   
.        

He      
's      
getting 
plenty  
of      
rest    
''      
.       

``       
Is       
his      
appetite 
improved 
''       
?        
?        

Or       
:        
``       
Does     
he       
get      
exercise 
''       
?        
?        

The        
exchange   
was        
almost     
invariable 
,          
and        
Scotty     
,          
in         
his        
bed        
,          
could      
hear       
every      
word       
of         
it         
.          

He     
never  
smiled 
.      

It        
required  
an        
energy    
he        
no        
longer    
possessed 
to        
be        
satirical 
about     
his       
father    
.         

His              
father           
would            
come             
upstairs         
and              
stand            
self-consciously 
at               
the              
foot             
of               
the              
bed              
and              
look             
at               
his              
son              
.                

After      
a          
pause      
,          
during     
which      
he         
studied    
Scotty     
's         
face       
as         
if         
Scotty     
were       
not        
there      
and        
could      
not        
study      
him        
too        
,          
Mr.        
McKinley   
would      
ask        
the        
same       
questions  
he         
had        
asked      
downstairs 
.          

Scotty         
would          
reply          
softly         
and            
his            
father         
,              
apologetically 
,              
would          
ask            
him            
to             
repeat         
.              

``     
I      
'm     
eating 
more   
''     
,      
he     
would  
say    
.      

Or     
:      
``     
I      
walk   
around 
the    
house  
a      
lot    
''     
.      

``      
Perhaps 
you     
should  
get     
out     
a       
little  
''      
.       

``       
I        
'm       
not      
supposed 
to       
yet      
''       
.        

He        
was       
not       
irritated 
.         

He        
did       
not       
mind      
the       
useless   
,         
kindly    
questions 
.         

He        
looked    
at        
the       
lined     
face      
with      
vague     
interest  
;         
;         
he        
felt      
he        
was       
noting    
it        
,         
as        
if        
it        
were      
something 
he        
might     
think     
about     
when      
he        
grew      
stronger  
.         

Mr.        
McKinley   
examined   
everything 
with       
critical   
care       
,          
seeking    
something  
material   
to         
blame      
for        
his        
son        
's         
illness    
.          

``       
Have     
you      
got      
enough   
blankets 
''       
?        
?        

And        
another    
time       
,          
without    
accusation 
:          
``         
You        
never      
wore       
that       
scarf      
I          
bought     
you        
''         
.          

Where        
their        
sharp        
edges        
seemed       
restless     
as           
sea          
waves        
thrusting    
themselves   
upward       
in           
angry        
motion       
,            
Papa-san     
sat          
glacier-like 
,            
his          
smooth       
solidity     
,            
his          
very         
immobility   
defying      
all          
the          
turmoil      
about        
him          
.            

``        
Our       
objective 
''        
,         
the       
colonel   
had       
said      
that      
day       
of        
the       
briefing  
,         
``        
is        
Papa-san  
''        
.         

There     
the       
objective 
sat       
,         
brooding  
over      
all       
.         

Gouge    
,        
burn     
,        
blast    
,        
insult   
it       
as       
they     
would    
,        
could    
anyone   
really   
take     
Papa-san 
?        
?        

Between    
the        
ponderous  
hulk       
and        
himself    
,          
in         
the        
valley     
over       
which      
Papa-san   
reigned    
,          
men        
had        
hidden     
high       
explosives 
,          
booby      
traps      
,          
and        
mines      
.          

The      
raped    
valley   
was      
a        
pregnant 
womb     
awaiting 
abortion 
.        

On        
the       
forward   
slope     
in        
front     
of        
his       
own       
post      
stretched 
two       
rows      
of        
barbed    
wire      
.         

At             
the            
slope          
's             
base           
coils          
of             
concertina     
stretched      
out            
of             
eye            
range          
like           
a              
wild           
tangle         
of             
children       
's             
hoops          
,              
stopped        
simultaneously 
,              
weirdly        
poised         
as             
if             
awaiting       
the            
magic          
of             
the            
child          
's             
touch          
to             
start          
them           
all            
rolling        
again          
.              

Closer     
still      
,          
regular    
barricades 
of         
barbed     
wire       
hung       
on         
timber     
supports   
.          

Was   
it    
all   
vain  
labor 
?     
?     

Who   
would 
clean 
up    
the   
mess  
when  
the   
war   
was   
over  
?     
?     

Smiling   
at        
his       
quixotic  
thoughts  
,         
Warren    
turned    
back      
from      
the       
opening   
and       
lit       
a         
cigarette 
before    
sitting   
down      
.         

Tonight   
a         
group     
of        
men       
,         
tomorrow  
night     
he        
himself   
,         
would     
go        
out       
there     
somewhere 
and       
wait      
.         

If        
he        
were      
to        
go        
with      
White     
,         
he        
would     
be        
out       
there     
two       
days      
,         
not       
just      
listening 
in        
the       
dark      
at        
some      
point     
between   
here      
and       
Papa-san  
,         
but       
moving    
ever      
deeper    
into      
enemy     
land      
--        
behind    
Papa-san  
--        
itself    
.         

Was      
this     
what     
he       
had      
expected 
?        
?        

He       
had      
n't      
realized 
that     
there    
would    
be       
so       
much     
time     
to       
think    
,        
so       
many     
lulls    
.        

Somehow      
he           
had          
forgotten    
what         
he           
must         
have         
been         
told         
,            
that         
combat       
was          
an           
intermittent 
activity     
.            

Now         
he          
knew        
that        
the         
moment      
illuminated 
by          
the         
vision      
on          
the         
train       
would       
have        
to          
be          
approached  
.           

It       
could    
take     
place    
tomorrow 
night    
,        
or       
it       
might    
occur    
months   
from     
now      
.        

There 
was   
just  
too   
much  
time  
.     

Time   
to     
become 
afraid 
.      

White      
's         
suggestion 
flattered  
,          
but        
he         
did        
not        
like       
the        
identity   
.          

He     
did    
not    
spill  
over   
with   
hatred 
for    
the    
enemy  
.      

He        
had       
n't       
even      
seen      
him       
yet       
Pressing  
his       
cigarette 
out       
in        
the       
earth     
,         
Warren    
walked    
to        
the       
slit      
and       
scanned   
the       
jagged    
hills     
.         

He          
saw         
no          
life        
,           
but         
still       
stood       
there       
for         
a           
time        
peering     
at          
the         
unlovely    
hills       
,           
his         
gaze        
continually 
returning   
to          
Papa-san    
.           

He      
had     
come    
here    
in      
order   
to      
test    
himself 
.       

While     
most      
of        
his       
beliefs   
were      
still     
unsettled 
,         
he        
knew      
that      
he        
did       
not       
believe   
in        
killing   
.         

Yet  
,    
he   
was  
here 
.    

He      
had     
come    
because 
he      
could   
not     
live    
out     
his     
life    
feeling 
that    
he      
had     
been    
a       
coward  
.       

There    
were     
ten      
men      
on       
the      
patrol   
which    
Sergeant 
Prevot   
led      
out      
that     
next     
night    
.        

The            
beaming        
ROK            
was            
carrying       
a              
thirty-caliber 
machine        
gun            
;              
;              
another        
man            
lugged         
the            
tripod         
and            
a              
box            
of             
ammunition     
.              

Warren   
and      
White    
each     
carried  
,        
in       
addition 
to       
their    
own      
weapons  
and      
ammo     
,        
a        
box      
of       
ammo     
for      
the      
ROK      
's       
machine  
gun      
.        

Others    
carried   
extra     
clips     
for       
the       
Browning  
Automatic 
Rifle     
,         
which     
was       
in        
the       
hands     
of        
a         
little    
Mexican   
named     
Martinez  
.         

Prevot    
had       
briefed   
the       
two       
new       
men       
that      
afternoon 
.         

``     
We     
just   
sit    
quiet  
and    
wait   
''     
,      
Prevot 
had    
said   
.      

``      
Be      
sure    
the     
man     
nearest 
you     
is      
awake   
.       

If    
Joe   
does  
n't   
show  
up    
,     
we    
'll   
all   
be    
back  
here  
at    
0600  
hours 
.     

Otherwise 
,         
we        
hold      
a         
reception 
.         

Then      
we        
pull      
out       
under     
our       
mortar    
and       
artillery 
cover     
,         
but       
nobody    
pulls     
out       
until     
I         
say       
so        
.         

Remember 
what     
I        
said     
about    
going    
out      
to       
get      
anybody  
left     
behind   
?        
?        

That  
still 
holds 
.     

We      
bring   
back    
all     
dead    
and     
wounded 
''      
.       

At        
2130      
hours     
they      
had       
passed    
through   
the       
barbed    
wire      
at        
the       
point     
of        
departure 
.         

Then    
began   
the     
journey 
through 
their   
own     
mine    
fields  
.       

Mines 
.     

Ours   
were   
kinder 
than   
theirs 
,      
some   
said   
.      

They       
set        
bouncing   
betties    
to         
jump       
and        
explode    
at         
testicle   
level      
while      
we         
more       
mercifully 
had        
them       
go         
off        
at         
the        
head       
.          

Mines 
.     

Big    
ones   
and    
little 
.      

The    
crude  
wooden 
boxes  
of     
the    
enemy  
,      
our    
nicely 
turned 
gray   
metal  
disks  
.      

But       
theirs    
defied    
the       
detectors 
.         

Mines 
.     

A         
foot      
misplaced 
,         
a         
leg       
missing   
.         

Mines 
.     

All     
sizes   
:       
big     
ones    
,       
some    
wired   
to      
set     
off     
a       
whole   
field   
,       
little  
ones    
,       
hand    
grenade 
size    
.       

Booby  
traps  
to     
fill   
the    
head   
with   
chunks 
of     
metal  
.      

Warren  
tried   
to      
shake   
off     
the     
jumble  
of      
his     
fears   
by      
looking 
at      
the     
sky     
.       

It   
was  
dark 
.    

Prevot       
had          
said         
that         
the          
searchlights 
would        
be           
bounced      
off          
the          
clouds       
at           
2230         
hours        
,            
``           
which        
gives        
us           
time         
to           
get          
settled      
in           
position     
''           
.            

Because 
they    
were    
new     
men     
and     
to      
be      
sure    
that    
they    
did     
n't     
get     
lost    
,       
Prevot  
had     
placed  
Warren  
and     
White   
in      
the     
center  
of      
the     
patrol  
as      
it      
filed   
out     
.       

His     
eyes    
now     
fixed   
on      
White   
's      
solid   
figure  
,       
Warren  
could   
hear    
behind  
him     
the     
tread   
of      
another 
.       

He       
could    
also     
hear     
the      
stream   
which    
he       
had      
seen     
from     
his      
position 
.        

They    
were    
going   
to      
follow  
it      
for     
part    
of      
their   
journey 
.       

``       
It       
's       
safe     
''       
,        
Prevot   
had      
said     
,        
``       
and      
it       
provides 
cover    
for      
our      
noise    
''       
.        

Soon    
they    
were    
picking 
their   
way     
along   
the     
edge    
of      
the     
stream  
which   
glowed  
in      
the     
night   
.       

On         
their      
right      
rose       
the        
embankment 
covered    
with       
brush      
and        
trees      
.          

If       
a        
branch   
extended 
out      
too      
far      
,        
each     
man      
held     
it       
back     
for      
the      
next     
,        
and      
if       
they     
met      
a        
low      
overhang 
,        
each     
warned   
the      
other    
.        

Thus       
,          
stealthily 
they       
advanced   
upstream   
;          
;          
then       
they       
turned     
to         
the        
right      
,          
climbed    
the        
embankment 
,          
and        
walked     
into       
the        
valley     
again      
.          

There     
was       
no        
cover     
here      
,         
only      
grass     
sighing   
against   
pant-legs 
.         

And       
with      
each      
sigh      
,         
like      
a         
whip      
in        
the       
hand      
of        
an        
expert    
,         
the       
grass     
stripped  
something 
from      
Warren    
.         

The         
gentle      
whir        
of          
each        
footstep    
left        
him         
more        
naked       
than        
before      
,           
until       
he          
felt        
his         
unprotected 
flesh       
tremble     
,           
chilled     
by          
each        
new         
sound       
.           

The      
shapes   
of       
the      
men      
ahead    
of       
him      
lacked   
solidity 
,        
as       
if       
the      
whip     
had      
stripped 
them     
of       
their    
very     
flesh    
.        

The        
dark       
forms      
moved      
like       
mourners   
on         
some       
nocturnal  
pilgrimage 
,          
their      
dirge      
unsung     
for        
want       
of         
vocal      
chords     
.          

The         
warped      
,           
broken      
trees       
in          
the         
valley      
assumed     
wraith-like 
shapes      
.           

Clumps    
of        
brush     
that      
they      
passed    
were      
so        
many      
enchained 
demons    
straining 
in        
anger     
to        
tear      
and       
gnaw      
on        
his       
bones     
.         

Looming       
over          
all           
,             
Papa-san      
leered        
down          
at            
him           
,             
threatening   
a             
hundred       
hidden        
malevolencies 
.             

Off         
in          
the         
distance    
a           
searchlight 
flashed     
on          
,           
its         
beam        
slashing    
the         
sky         
.           

The       
sharp     
ray       
was       
absorbed  
by        
a         
cloud     
,         
then      
reflected 
to        
the       
earth     
in        
a         
softer    
,         
diffused  
radiance  
.         

Somewhere 
over      
there     
another   
patrol    
had       
need      
of        
light     
.         

Warren     
thought    
of         
all        
the        
men        
out        
that       
night      
who        
,          
like       
himself    
,          
had        
left       
their      
protective 
ridge      
and        
--         
fear       
working    
at         
their      
guts       
--         
picked     
their      
way        
into       
the        
area       
beyond     
.          

From         
the          
east         
to           
the          
west         
coast        
of           
the          
Korean       
peninsula    
was          
a            
strip        
of           
land         
in           
which        
fear-filled  
men          
were         
at           
that         
same         
moment       
furtively    
crawling     
through      
the          
night        
,            
sitting      
in           
sweaty       
anticipation 
of           
any          
movement     
or           
sound        
,            
or           
shouting     
amidst       
confused     
rifle        
flashes      
and          
muzzle       
blasts       
.            

White  
's     
arm    
went   
up     
and    
Warren 
raised 
his    
own    
.      

The      
patrol   
was      
stopping 
.        

Prevot 
came   
up     
.      

``        
Take      
that      
spot      
over      
there     
''        
,         
he        
whispered 
,         
pointing  
to        
a         
small     
clump     
of        
blackness 
.         

``      
Give    
me      
your    
machine 
gun     
ammo    
''      
.       

Warren      
handed      
him         
the         
metal       
box         
and         
Prevot      
quietly     
disappeared 
down        
the         
line        
.           

Lying  
in     
the    
grass  
behind 
the    
brush  
clump  
,      
Warren 
looked 
about  
.      

The        
others     
likewise   
had        
hidden     
themselves 
in         
the        
grass      
and        
the        
brush      
.          

Over     
his      
shoulder 
he       
could    
see      
Prevot   
with     
the      
machine  
gun      
crew     
.        

Even     
at       
this     
short    
distance 
they     
were     
only     
vague    
shapes   
,        
setting  
up       
the      
machine  
gun      
on       
a        
small    
knoll    
so       
that     
it       
could    
fire     
above    
the      
heads    
of       
the      
rest     
of       
the      
patrol   
.        

Warren     
eased      
his        
rifle      
's         
safety     
off        
and        
gently     
,          
slowly     
sneaked    
another    
clip       
of         
ammunition 
from       
one        
of         
the        
cloth      
bandoleers 
that       
marked     
the        
upper      
part       
of         
his        
body       
with       
an         
A[fj]      
.          

This   
he     
placed 
within 
quick  
reach  
.      

The      
walk     
and      
his      
fears    
had      
served   
to       
overheat 
him      
and      
his      
sweaty   
armpits  
cooled   
at       
the      
touch    
of       
the      
night    
air      
.        

Although 
the      
armored  
vest     
fitted   
the      
upper    
part     
of       
his      
body     
snugly   
,        
he       
felt     
no       
security 
.        

Figures     
seemed      
to          
crouch      
in          
the         
surrounding 
dark        
;           
;           
in          
the         
distance    
he          
saw         
a           
band        
of          
men         
who         
seemed      
to          
advance     
and         
retreat     
even        
as          
he          
watched     
.           

Certain    
this       
menace     
was        
only       
imaginary  
,          
he         
yet        
stared     
in         
fascinated 
horror     
,          
his        
hand       
sticky     
against    
the        
stock      
of         
his        
weapon     
.          

He        
was       
aware     
of        
insistent 
inner     
beatings  
,         
as        
if        
prisoners 
within    
sought    
release   
from      
his       
rigid     
body      
.         

Above       
,           
the         
glowing     
ivory       
baton       
of          
their       
searchlight 
pointed     
at          
the         
clouds      
,           
diluting    
the         
valley      
's          
dark        
to          
a           
pallid      
light       
.           

Then       
the        
figures    
which      
held       
his        
attention  
became     
a          
group      
of         
shattered  
trees      
,          
standing   
like       
the        
grotesques 
of         
a          
medieval   
damnation  
scene      
.          

Even    
so      
,       
he      
could   
not     
ease    
the     
tension 
of      
his     
body    
;       
;       
the     
rough   
surface 
of      
the     
earth   
itself  
seemed  
to      
resist  
every   
attempt 
on      
his     
part    
to      
relax   
.       

Sensing        
the            
unseen         
presence       
of             
the            
other          
men            
in             
the            
patrol         
,              
he             
felt           
mutely         
united         
to             
these          
nine           
near-strangers 
sharing        
this           
pinpoint       
of             
being          
with           
him            
.              

He             
sensed         
something      
precious       
in             
the            
perilous       
moment         
,              
something      
akin           
to             
the            
knowledge      
gained         
on             
his            
bicycle        
trip           
through        
the            
French         
countryside    
,              
a              
knowledge      
imprisoned     
in             
speechlessness 
.              

--         
In         
France     
he         
had        
puzzled    
the        
meaning    
of         
the        
great      
stone      
monuments  
men        
had        
thrown     
up         
to         
the        
sky        
,          
and        
always     
as         
he         
wandered   
,          
he         
felt       
a          
stranger   
to         
their      
exultation 
.          

They     
were     
poems    
in       
a        
strange  
language 
,        
of       
which    
he       
could    
barely   
touch    
a        
meaning  
--       
enough   
to       
make     
his      
being    
ache     
with     
the      
desire   
for      
the      
fullness 
he       
sensed   
there    
.        

Brittany   
,          
that       
stone-gray 
mystery    
through    
which      
he         
traveled   
for        
thirty     
days       
,          
sleeping   
in         
the        
barns      
of         
farmers    
or         
alongside  
roads      
,          
had        
worked     
some       
subtle     
change     
in         
him        
,          
he         
knew       
,          
and        
it         
was        
in         
Brittany   
that       
he         
had        
met        
Pierre     
.          

Pierre  
had     
no      
hands   
;       
;       
they    
had     
been    
severed 
at      
the     
wrists  
.       

With       
leather    
cups       
fitted     
in         
his        
handlebars 
,          
he         
steered    
his        
bicycle    
.          

He       
and      
Warren   
had      
traveled 
together 
for      
four     
days     
.        

They      
visited   
the       
shipyards 
at        
Brest     
and       
Pierre    
had       
to        
sign      
the       
register  
,         
vouching  
for       
the       
integrity 
of        
the       
visiting  
foreigner 
.         

He     
took   
the    
pen    
in     
his    
stumps 
and    
began  
to     
write  
.      

``       
Wait     
!        
!        
Wait     
''       
!        
!        
Cried    
the      
guard    
who      
ran      
from     
the      
hut      
to       
shout    
to       
other    
men      
standing 
about    
outside  
.        

They      
crowded   
the       
small     
room      
and       
peered    
over      
one       
another   
's        
shoulders 
to        
watch     
the       
handless  
man       
write     
his       
name      
in        
the       
book      
.         

``         
C'est      
formidable 
''         
,          
they       
exclaimed  
.          

``   
Mais 
,    
oui  
.    

C'est       
merveilleux 
''          
.           

And         
then        
the         
questions   
came        
,           
eager       
,           
interested  
questions   
,           
and         
many        
compliments 
on          
his         
having      
overcome    
his         
infirmity   
.           

``     
Does   
n't    
it     
ever   
bother 
you    
''     
,      
Warren 
had    
asked  
,      
``     
to     
have   
people 
always 
asking 
you    
about  
your   
hands  
''     
?      
?      

``      
Oh      
,       
the     
French  
are     
a       
very    
curious 
people  
''      
,       
Pierre  
had     
laughed 
.       

``      
They    
are     
also    
honest  
seekers 
after   
truth   
.       

Now       
the       
English   
are       
painfully 
silent    
about     
my        
missing   
hands     
.         

They    
refuse  
to      
mention 
or      
to      
notice  
that    
they    
are     
not     
there   
.       

The       
Americans 
,         
like      
yourself  
,         
take      
the       
fact      
for       
granted   
,         
try       
to        
be        
helpful   
,         
but       
do        
n't       
ask       
questions 
.         

I          
'm         
used       
to         
all        
three      
,          
but        
I          
think      
the        
French     
have       
the        
healthiest 
attitude   
''         
.          

That     
was      
the      
day      
that     
Pierre   
had      
told     
Warren   
about    
the      
Abbey    
of       
Solesmes 
.        

``      
You     
are     
looking 
tired   
and     
there   
you     
can     
rest    
.       

It   
will 
be   
good 
for  
you  
.    

I           
think       
,           
too         
''          
,           
he          
said        
,           
his         
dark        
eyes        
mischievous 
,           
``          
that        
you         
will        
find        
there       
some        
clue        
to          
the         
secret      
of          
the         
cathedrals  
about       
which       
you         
have        
spoken      
''          
.           

Within  
two     
weeks   
Warren  
was     
ringing 
the     
bell    
at      
the     
abbey   
gate    
.       

The         
monk        
who         
opened      
the         
door        
immediately 
calmed      
his         
worries     
about       
his         
reception   
:           
``          
I           
speak       
English     
''          
,           
the         
old         
man         
said        
,           
``          
but         
I           
do          
not         
hear        
it          
very        
well        
''          
.           

He        
smiled    
and       
stuck     
a         
large     
finger    
with      
white     
hairs     
sprouting 
on        
it        
into      
his       
ear       
as        
though    
that      
might     
help      
.         

Smiling       
at            
Warren        
's            
protestations 
,             
the           
old           
monk          
took          
his           
grip          
from          
him           
and           
led           
him           
down          
a             
corridor      
to            
a             
small         
parlor        
.             

``     
Will   
you    
please 
wait   
in     
here   
.      

Mickie              
sat                 
over                
his                 
second              
whisky-on-the-rocks 
in                  
a                   
little              
bar                 
next                
to                  
the                 
funeral             
parlor              
on                  
Pennsylvania        
Avenue              
.                   

Al      
's      
Little  
Cafe    
was     
small   
,       
dark    
,       
narrow  
,       
and     
filled  
with    
the     
mingled 
scent   
of      
beer    
,       
tobacco 
smoke   
,       
and     
Italian 
cooking 
.       

Hanging  
over     
the      
bar      
was      
an       
oil      
painting 
of       
a        
nude     
Al       
had      
accepted 
from     
a        
student  
at       
the      
Corcoran 
Gallery  
who      
needed   
to       
eat      
and      
drink    
and      
was      
broke    
.        

The          
nude         
was          
small        
and          
black-haired 
and          
elfin        
,            
and          
was          
called       
``           
Eloise       
''           
.            

This     
was      
one      
place    
where    
Moonan   
could    
go       
for      
a        
drink    
in       
a        
back     
booth    
without  
anyone   
noticing 
him      
,        
or       
at       
least    
coming   
up       
and      
hanging  
around   
and      
wanting  
to       
know     
all      
the      
low-down 
.        

The         
other       
patrons     
were        
taxi        
drivers     
and         
art         
students    
and         
small       
shopkeepers 
.           

The        
reporters  
had        
not        
yet        
discovered 
that       
this       
was        
his        
hideaway   
.          

His    
friend 
Jane   
was    
with   
him    
.      

She     
was     
wise    
enough  
to      
realize 
a       
man     
could   
be      
good    
company 
even    
if      
he      
did     
weigh   
too     
much    
and     
did     
n't     
own     
the     
mint    
.       

She        
was        
the        
widow      
of         
a          
writer     
who        
had        
died       
in         
an         
airplane   
crash      
,          
and        
Mickie     
had        
found      
her        
a          
job        
as         
head       
of         
the        
historical 
section    
of         
the        
Treasury   
.          

This      
meant     
sorting   
out       
press     
clippings 
and       
the       
like      
.         

Jane       
sat        
receptive  
and        
interested 
.          

Mickie    
had       
a         
pleasant  
glow      
as        
he        
said      
,         
``        
You       
see       
,         
both      
of        
them      
,         
I         
mean      
the       
President 
and       
Jeff      
Lawrence  
,         
are       
romantics 
.         

A        
romantic 
is       
one      
who      
thinks   
the      
world    
is       
divinely 
inspired 
and      
all      
he       
has      
to       
do       
is       
find     
the      
right    
key      
,        
and      
then     
divine   
justice  
and      
altruism 
will     
appear   
.        

It       
's       
like     
focusing 
a        
camera   
;        
;        
the      
distant  
ship     
is       
n't      
there    
until    
you      
get      
the      
focus    
.        

You     
know    
what    
I       
'm      
talking 
about   
.       

I     
'm    
sure  
all   
girls 
feel  
this  
way   
about 
men   
until 
they  
live  
with  
them  
.     

``      
But     
when    
it      
comes   
to      
war     
,       
the     
Colonel 
knows   
what    
it      
is      
and     
Jeff    
does    
n't     
.       

Mr.           
Christiansen  
knows         
that          
a             
soldier       
will          
get           
the           
Distinguished 
Service       
Medal         
for           
conduct       
that          
would         
land          
him           
in            
prison        
for           
life          
or            
the           
electric      
chair         
as            
a             
civilian      
.             

He       
had      
a        
mean     
,        
unbroken 
sheer    
bastard  
in       
his      
outfit   
,        
and      
someone  
invented 
the      
name     
Trig     
for      
him      
.        

That    
's      
to      
say     
,       
he      
was     
trigger 
happy   
.       

He       
'd       
shoot    
at       
anything 
if       
it       
was      
the      
rear     
end      
of       
a        
horse    
or       
his      
own      
sentry   
.        

He          
was         
a           
wiry        
,           
inscrutable 
,           
silent      
country     
boy         
from        
the         
red         
clay        
of          
rural       
Alabama     
,           
and         
he          
spoke       
with        
the         
broad       
drawl       
that        
others      
normally    
make        
fun         
of          
.           

But   
not   
in    
front 
of    
Trig  
.     

I      
heard  
of     
some   
that   
tried  
it     
back   
in     
the    
States 
,      
and    
he     
'd     
knock  
them   
clear  
across 
the    
room   
.      

There    
'd       
been     
a        
pretty   
bad      
incident 
back     
at       
the      
Marine   
base     
.        

A       
New     
York    
kid     
,       
a       
refugee 
from    
one     
of      
the     
Harlem  
gangs   
,       
made    
fun     
of      
Trig    
's      
accent  
,       
and     
drew    
a       
knife   
.       

Before     
the        
fight      
was        
over       
,          
the        
Harlem     
boy        
had        
a          
concussion 
and        
Trig       
was        
cut        
up         
badly      
.          

They     
caught   
Trig     
stealing 
liquor   
from     
the      
officers 
'        
mess     
,        
and      
he       
got      
a        
couple   
of       
girls    
in       
trouble  
.        

The        
fear       
of         
punishment 
just       
did        
n't        
bother     
him        
.          

It    
was   
n't   
there 
.     

It    
was   
left  
out   
of    
him   
at    
birth 
.     

This        
is          
why         
he          
made        
such        
a           
magnificent 
soldier     
.           

He            
was           
n't           
troubled      
with          
the           
ordinary      
,             
rank-and-file 
fear          
that          
overcomes     
and           
paralyzes     
and           
sends         
individual    
soldiers      
and           
whole         
companies     
under         
fire          
running       
in            
panic         
.             

It       
just     
did      
n't      
occur    
to       
Trig     
that     
anything 
serious  
would    
happen   
to       
him      
.        

Do      
you     
get     
the     
picture 
of      
the     
kind    
of      
fellow  
he      
was     
''      
?       
?       

Jane     
nodded   
with     
a        
pleasant 
smile    
.        

``    
All   
right 
.     

There    
was      
a        
sniper   
's       
nest     
in       
a        
mountain 
cave     
,        
and      
it       
was      
picking  
off      
our      
men      
with     
devilish 
accuracy 
.        

The        
Colonel    
ordered    
that       
it         
be         
wiped      
out        
,          
and        
I          
suggested  
,          
'          
You        
ask        
for        
volunteers 
,          
and        
promise    
each       
man        
on         
the        
patrol     
a          
quart      
of         
whisky     
,          
ten        
dollars    
and        
a          
week-end   
pass       
to         
Davao      
.          

Trig       
was        
one        
of         
the        
five       
volunteers 
.          

The        
patrol     
snaked     
around     
in         
back       
of         
the        
cave       
,          
approached 
it         
from       
above      
and        
dropped    
in         
suddenly   
with       
wild       
howls      
.          

You     
could   
hear    
them    
from    
our     
outpost 
.       

There    
was      
a        
lot      
of       
shooting 
.        

We      
knew    
the     
enemy   
was     
subdued 
,       
because 
a       
flare   
was     
fired   
as      
the     
signal  
.       

So      
we      
hurried 
over    
.       

Two     
of      
our     
men     
were    
killed  
,       
a       
third   
was     
wounded 
.       

Trig         
and          
a            
very         
black        
colored      
boy          
from         
Detroit      
had          
killed       
or           
put          
out          
of           
action       
ten          
guerrillas   
by           
grenades     
and          
hand-to-hand 
fighting     
.            

When       
we         
got        
there      
,          
Trig       
and        
the        
Negro      
were       
quarreling 
over       
possession 
of         
a          
gold       
crucifix   
around     
the        
neck       
of         
a          
wounded    
Filipino   
.          

The     
colored 
boy     
had     
it      
,       
and     
Trig    
lunged  
at      
him     
with    
a       
knife   
and     
said    
,       
'       
Give    
that    
to      
me      
,       
you     
black   
bastard 
.       

We       
do       
n't      
'low     
nigras   
to       
walk     
on       
the      
same     
sidewalk 
with     
white    
men      
where    
I        
come     
from     
.        

``    
The   
Negro 
got   
a     
bad   
slice 
on    
his   
chest 
from  
the   
knife 
wound 
''    
.     

``         
What       
did        
the        
Colonel    
do         
about      
the        
men        
''         
?          
?          
Jane       
asked      
in         
her        
placid     
,          
interested 
way        
.          

Mickie  
laughed 
.       

``               
He               
recommended      
both             
of               
them             
for              
the              
DSM              
and              
the              
Detroit          
fellow           
for              
the              
Purple           
Heart            
,                
too              
,                
for              
a                
combat-inflicted 
wound            
.                

So           
you          
see          
Mr.          
Christiansen 
knows        
what         
it           
's           
all          
about        
.            

But      
not      
Jeff     
Lawrence 
.        

When      
he        
was       
in        
the       
war       
,         
he        
was       
in        
Law       
or        
Supplies  
or        
something 
like      
that      
,         
and       
an        
old       
buddy     
of        
his       
told      
me        
he        
would     
come      
down      
on        
Sundays   
to        
the       
Pentagon  
and       
read      
the       
citations 
for       
medals    
--        
just      
like      
the       
one       
we        
sent      
in        
for       
Trig      
--        
and       
go        
away      
with      
a         
real      
glow      
.         

These  
were   
heroes 
nine   
feet   
tall   
to     
him    
''     
.      

Jefferson 
Lawrence  
was       
alone     
at        
the       
small     
,         
perfectly 
appointed 
table     
by        
the       
window    
looking   
out       
over      
the       
river     
.         

He       
had      
dinner   
and      
sat      
there    
over     
his      
coffee   
watching 
the      
winding  
pattern  
of       
traffic  
as       
it       
crossed  
the      
bridge   
and      
spread   
out      
like     
a        
serpent  
with     
two      
heads    
.        

Beside   
him      
was      
Mrs.     
Dalloway 
.        

He          
thought     
how         
this        
dainty      
,           
fragile     
older       
woman       
threading   
her         
way         
through     
the         
streets     
of          
Westminster 
on          
a           
day         
in          
June        
,           
enjoying    
the         
flowers     
in          
the         
shops       
,           
the         
greetings   
from        
old         
friends     
,           
but         
never       
really      
drawing     
a           
deep        
,           
passionate  
breath      
,           
was         
so          
like        
himself     
.           

He         
,          
and        
Mrs.       
Dalloway   
,          
too        
,          
had        
never      
permitted  
themselves 
the        
luxury     
of         
joys       
that       
dug        
into       
the        
bone       
marrow     
of         
the        
spirit     
.          

He        
had       
not       
because   
he        
was       
both      
poor      
and       
ambitious 
.         

Poverty   
imposes   
a         
kind      
of        
chastity  
on        
the       
ambitious 
.         

They    
can     
not     
stop    
to      
grasp   
and     
embrace 
and     
sit     
in      
the     
back    
seat    
of      
cars    
along   
a       
dark    
country 
lane    
.       

No      
,       
they    
must    
look    
the     
other   
way     
and     
climb   
one     
more    
painful 
step    
up      
the     
ladder  
.       

He       
made     
the      
decision 
with     
his      
eyes     
open     
,        
or       
so       
he       
thought  
.        

At           
any          
cost         
,            
he           
must         
leave        
the          
dreary       
Pennsylvania 
mining       
town         
where        
his          
father       
was          
a            
pharmacist   
.            

And 
so  
he  
had 
,   
so  
he  
had 
.   

At      
State   
College 
,       
he      
had     
no      
time    
to      
walk    
among   
the     
violets 
on      
the     
water   
's      
edge    
.       

From        
his         
room        
he          
could       
look        
out         
in          
springtime  
and         
see         
the         
couples     
hand        
in          
hand        
walking     
slowly      
,           
deliciously 
,           
across      
the         
campus      
,           
and         
he          
could       
smell       
the         
sweet       
vernal      
winds       
.           

He    
was   
not   
stone 
.     

He      
was     
not     
unmoved 
.       

He        
had       
to        
teach     
himself   
patiently 
that      
these     
traps     
were      
not       
for       
him       
.         

He       
must     
mentally 
pull     
the      
blinds   
and      
close    
the      
window   
,        
so       
that     
all      
that     
existed  
was      
in       
the      
books    
before   
him      
.        

At     
law    
school 
,      
the    
same   
.      

More     
of       
this     
stamping 
down     
of       
human    
emotion  
as       
a        
young    
lawyer   
in       
New      
York     
.        

By         
the        
time       
he         
was        
prosperous 
enough     
--         
his        
goals      
were       
high       
--         
he         
was        
bald       
and        
afraid     
of         
women      
.          

The     
only    
one     
who     
would   
have    
him     
was     
his     
cripple 
,       
the     
strange 
unhappy 
woman   
who     
became  
his     
wife    
.       

Perhaps 
it      
was     
right   
;       
;       
perhaps 
it      
was     
just    
.       

He       
had      
dared    
to       
defy     
nature   
,        
to       
turn     
his      
back     
to       
the      
Lorelei  
,        
and      
he       
was      
punished 
.        

Like       
Mrs.       
Dalloway   
,          
with       
her        
regrets    
about      
Peter      
Walsh      
,          
he         
had        
his        
moments    
of         
melancholy 
over       
a          
youth      
too        
well       
spent      
.          

If       
he       
had      
had      
a        
son      
,        
he       
would    
tell     
him      
,        
``       
Gather   
ye       
rosebuds 
while    
ye       
may      
This     
same     
flower   
that     
smiles   
today    
tomorrow 
will     
be       
dying    
''       
.        

But    
then   
his    
son    
could  
afford 
it     
.      

Lawrence 
was      
waiting  
for      
Bill     
Boxell   
.        

The       
Vice      
President 
had       
called    
and       
asked     
if        
he        
could     
see       
the       
Secretary 
at        
his       
home      
.         

He     
said   
the    
matter 
was    
urgent 
.      

The       
Secretary 
was       
uneasy    
about     
the       
visit     
.         

He     
did    
not    
like   
Boxell 
.      

He          
suspected   
something   
underhanded 
and         
furtive     
about       
him         
.           

Lawrence  
could     
not       
put       
his       
finger    
on        
it        
precisely 
,         
and       
this      
worried   
him       
.         

When       
you        
disliked   
or         
distrusted 
a          
man        
,          
you        
should     
have       
a          
reason     
.          

Human  
nature 
was    
not    
a      
piece  
of     
meat   
you    
could  
tell   
was    
bad    
by     
its    
smell  
.      

Lawrence  
stared    
a         
minute    
at        
the       
lighted   
ribbon    
of        
traffic   
,         
hoping    
that      
a         
clue      
to        
his       
dislike   
of        
the       
Vice      
President 
would     
appear    
.         

It  
did 
not 
.   

Therefore  
,          
he         
decided    
he         
was        
unfair     
to         
the        
young      
man        
and        
should     
make       
an         
effort     
to         
understand 
and        
sympathize 
with       
his        
point      
of         
view       
.          

A         
half      
hour      
later     
the       
Vice      
President 
arrived   
.         

He          
looked      
very        
carefully   
at          
every       
piece       
of          
furnishing  
,           
as          
though      
hoping      
to          
store       
this        
information 
carefully   
in          
his         
mind        
.           

He         
observed   
the        
Florentine 
vase       
in         
the        
hall       
,          
the        
Renoir     
painting   
in         
the        
library    
,          
as         
well       
as         
the        
long       
shelves    
of         
well-bound 
volumes    
;          
;          
the        
pattern    
of         
the        
Oriental   
rug        
,          
the        
delicate   
cut-glass  
chandelier 
.          

He           
said         
to           
the          
Secretary    
,            
``           
I            
understand   
you          
came         
from         
a            
little       
Pennsylvania 
town         
near         
Wilkes-Barre 
.            

How   
did   
you   
find  
out   
about 
this  
''    
?     
?     

He          
waved       
his         
arm         
around      
at          
the         
furnishings 
.           

It           
was          
not          
a            
discourteous 
question     
,            
Lawrence     
decided      
.            

This    
young   
man     
had     
so      
little  
time    
to      
learn   
he      
had     
to      
be      
curious 
;       
;       
he      
had     
to      
find    
out     
.       

The        
Secretary  
did        
not        
tell       
him        
at         
what       
cost       
,          
at         
what       
loneliness 
,          
he         
learned    
these      
things     
.          

He        
merely    
said      
,         
``        
Any       
good      
decorator 
these     
days      
can       
make      
you       
a         
tasteful  
home      
''        
.         

The         
Vice        
President   
said        
,           
``          
If          
you         
hear        
of          
any         
names       
that        
would       
fix         
me          
cheap       
in          
return      
for         
advertising 
they        
decorated   
the         
Vice        
President   
's          
home        
,           
let         
me          
know        
.           

I        
can      
do       
business 
with     
that     
kind     
''       
.        

Again    
,        
Lawrence 
thought  
a        
little   
sadly    
,        
these    
were     
the      
fees     
of       
poverty  
and      
ambition 
.        

Boxell     
did        
not        
have       
the        
chance     
to         
grow       
up         
graciously 
.          

He         
had        
to         
acquire    
everything 
he         
was        
going      
to         
get        
in         
four       
years      
.          

They    
had     
brandy  
in      
the     
library 
.       

Boxell      
looked      
at          
Lawrence    
with        
a           
searching   
glance      
,           
the         
kind        
that        
a           
prosecuting 
attorney    
would       
give        
a           
man         
on          
trial       
.           

What       
are        
your       
weaknesses 
?          
?          

Where 
will  
you   
break 
?     
?     

How     
best    
to      
destroy 
your    
peace   
?       
?       

The       
Vice      
President 
said      
with      
a         
slight    
bluster   
,         
``        
There     
is        
n't       
anyone    
who       
loves     
the       
President 
more      
than      
I         
do        
.         

Old   
Chris 
is    
my    
ideal 
.     

At         
the        
same       
time       
,          
you        
have       
to         
face       
facts      
and        
realize    
that       
a          
man        
who        
's         
been       
in         
the        
Marine     
Corps      
all        
his        
life       
does       
n't        
understand 
much       
about      
politics   
.          

What  
does  
a     
monk  
know  
about 
sex   
''    
?     
?     

Lawrence  
listened  
with      
the       
practiced 
,         
deceptive 
calm      
of        
the       
lawyer    
,         
but       
his       
face      
was       
in        
the       
shadow    
.         

``      
So      
,       
we      
have    
to      
protect 
the     
old     
man     
for     
his     
own     
good    
.       

You  
see  
what 
I    
mean 
.    

Congress    
is          
full        
of          
politicians 
,           
and         
if          
you         
want        
to          
get         
along       
with        
them        
,           
you         
have        
to          
be          
politic     
.           

This     
is       
why      
I        
say      
we       
just     
ca       
n't      
go       
ahead    
and      
disarm   
the      
Germans  
and      
pull     
down     
our      
own      
defenses 
.        

Let      
me       
tell     
you      
what     
happened 
to       
me       
today    
.        

A          
fellow     
came       
up         
to         
me         
,          
a          
Senator    
,          
I          
do         
n't        
have       
to         
tell       
you        
his        
name       
,          
and        
he         
told       
me         
,          
'          
I          
love       
the        
President  
like       
a          
brother    
,          
but        
God        
damn       
it         
,          
he         
's         
crucifying 
me         
.          

I          
've        
got        
a          
quarter    
of         
a          
million    
Germans    
in         
my         
state      
,          
and        
those      
krautheads 
tune       
in         
on         
Father     
Werther    
every      
night      
,          
and        
if         
he         
tells      
them       
to         
go         
out        
and        
piss       
in         
the        
public     
square     
,          
that       
's         
what       
they       
do         
.          

He          
's          
telling     
them        
now         
to          
write       
letters     
to          
their       
Congressmen 
opposing    
the         
disarmament 
of          
Germany     
.           

And      
another  
one      
comes    
to       
me       
and      
he       
says     
,        
'        
Look     
here     
,        
there    
's       
a        
mill     
in       
my       
state    
employs  
five     
thousand 
people   
making   
uniforms 
for      
the      
Navy     
.
